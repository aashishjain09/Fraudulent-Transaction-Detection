# Fraudulent-Transaction-Detection
A machine learning model for predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company and use insights from the model to develop an actionable plan.
This project is created with an aim to detect and counter fraudulent activities in a Financial businees firm by some of the agents.

The constraints towards predicting fraud transaction are as below:
1. Whether the transaction is done between two customers of normal transaction history.
2. The amount of transaction must be greater than 200,000. 
3. The recipient account balance info is not available for Merchant accounts.


The success of the machine learning model is determined by the accuracy of model in detecting the classified data into fraudulent transactions and normal transaction.
Moreover, the outcome is tested logically with the following business related questions:
1. Data cleaning including missing values, outliers and multi-collinearity.
2. Describe your fraud detection model in elaboration.
3. How did you select variables to be included in the model?
4. Demonstrate the performance of the model by using best set of tools.
5. What are the key factors that predict fraudulent customer?
6. Do these factors make sense? If yes, How? If not, How not?
7. What kind of prevention should be adopted while company update its infrastructure?
8. Assuming these actions have been implemented, how would you determine if they work?
